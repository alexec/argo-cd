## v1.3.0 (2019-11-13)

## Quick Start
### Non-HA:
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v1.3.0/manifests/install.yaml
```

kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v1.3.0/manifests/ha/install.yaml
```

#### New Features

##### Helm 1st-Class Support

We know that for many of our users, they want to deploy existing Helm charts using Argo CD. Up until now that has required you to create an Argo CD app in a Git repo that does nothing but point to that chart. Now you can use a Helm chart repository is the same way as a Git repository.

On top of that, we've improved support for Helm apps. The most common types of Helm hooks such as `pre-install` and `post-install` are supported as well as a the delete policy `before-hook-creation` which makes it easier to work with hooks.

##### Orphan Resources

Some users would like to make sure that resources in a namespace are managed only by Argo CD. So we've introduced the concept of an "orphan resource" - any resource that is in namespace associated with an app, but not managed by Argo CD. This is enabled in the project settings. Once enabled, Argo CD will show in the app view any resources in the app's namepspace that is not mananged by Argo CD. 

https://youtu.be/9ZoTevVQf5I

##### Sync Windows

There may be instances when you want to control the times during which an Argo CD app can sync. Sync Windows now gives you the capability to create windows of time in which apps are either allowed or denied the ability to sync. This can apply to both manual and auto-sync, or just auto-sync. The windows are configured at the project level and assigned to apps using app name, namespace or cluster. Wildcards are supported for all fields.

### New Features

#### Server Certificate And Known Hosts Management

The Server Certificate And Known Hosts Management feature makes it really easy to connect private Git repositories to Argo CD. Now Argo CD provides UI and CLI which
enables managing certificates and known hosts which are used to access Git repositories. It is also possible to configure both hosts and certificates in a declarative manner using
[argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/docs/operator-manual/argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm.yaml) and 
[argocd-tls-certs-cm.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/docs/operator-manual/argocd-tls-certs-cm.yaml) config maps.

#### Self-Healing

The existing Automatic Sync feature allows to automatically apply any new changes in Git to the target Kubernetes cluster. However, Automatic Sync does not cover the case when the
application is out of sync due to the unexpected change in the target cluster. The Self-Healing feature fills this gap. With Self-Healing enabled Argo CD automatically pushes the desired state from Git into the cluster every time when state deviation is detected.

**Anonymous access** - enable read-only access without authentication to anyone in your organization.

Support for Git LFS enabled repositories - now you can store Helm charts as tar files and enable Git LFS in your repository.

**Compact diff view** - compact diff summary of the whole application in a single view.

**Badge for application status** - add badge with the health and sync status of your application into README.md of your deployment repo.

**Allow configuring google analytics tracking** - use Google Analytics to check how many users are visiting UI or your Argo CD instance.

#### Backward Incompatible Changes
- Kustomize v1 support is removed. All kustomize charts are built using the same Kustomize version
- Kustomize v2.0.3 upgraded to v3.1.0 . We've noticed one backward incompatible change: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/42 . Starting v2.1.0 namespace prefix feature works with CRD ( which might cause renaming of generated resource definitions)
- Argo CD config maps must be annotated with `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd` label. Make sure to apply updated `install.yaml` manifest in addition to changing image version.

### New Features

#### Sync Waves

Sync waves feature allows executing a sync operation in a number of steps or waves. Within each synchronization phase (pre-sync, sync, post-sync) you can have one or more waves,
than allows you to ensure certain resources are healthy before subsequent resources are synced.

#### Optimized interaction with Git

Argo CD needs to execute `git fetch` operation to access application manifests and `git ls-remote` to resolve ambiguous git revision. The `git ls-remote` is executed very frequently
and although the operation is very lightweight it adds unnecessary load on Git server and might cause performance issues. In v1.1 release, the application reconciliation process was
optimized which significantly reduced the number of Git requests. With v1.1 release, Argo CD should send 3x ~ 5x fewer Git requests.

#### User defined Application metadata

User-defined Application metadata enables the user to define a list of useful URLs for their specific application and expose those links on the UI
(e.g. reference tp a CI pipeline or an application-specific management tool). These links should provide helpful shortcuts that make easier to integrate Argo CD into existing
systems by making it easier to find other components inside and outside Argo CD.

### Deprecation Notice

* Kustomize v1.0 is deprecated and support will be removed in the Argo CD v1.2 release.

## v1.0.2 (2019-06-14)

## Quick Start
### Non-HA:
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v1.0.2/manifests/install.yaml
```
### HA:
```

### Changes since v1.0.1

* Cluster registration was unintentionally persisting client-cert auth credentials (#1742)

## Checking if Argo CD is storing unneccesry credentials.

The following instructions explain if any action is needed to remove certificate-authentication data from Argo CD:

1. Run the following command and see if you see key data. If there is non-null output (e.g. output like the following), then Argo CD is storing unnecessary credentials and the cluster credentials should be re-added.

```shell
kubectl get secret cluster-192.168.64.66-892108214 -o json | jq -r '.data.config' | base64 --decode | jq -r '.tlsClientConfig.keyData'

```

If the secret does not contain key data (i.e. output like the following), then no action is necessary:
```shell
$ kubectl get secret cluster-192.168.64.66-892108214 -o json | jq -r '.data.config' | base64 --decode | jq -r '.tlsClientConfig.keyData'
null
```

2. If key data is stored in the secret, run the following commands to re-add the cluster to Argo CD. **_IMPORTANT_**: ensure you are using argocd v1.0.2 CLI or greater.

```shell
$ argocd cluster rm CLUSTERURL
$ argocd cluster add CONTEXTNAME
```

## v1.0.1 (2019-05-28)

```

### New Features

#### Network View

A new way to visual application resources had been introduced to the Application Details page. The Network View visualizes connections between Ingresses, Services and Pods
based on ingress reference service, service's label selectors and labels. The new view is useful to understand the application traffic flow and troubleshot connectivity issues.

#### Custom Actions

Argo CD introduces Custom Resource Actions to allow users to provide their own Lua scripts to modify existing Kubernetes resources in their applications. These actions are exposed in the UI to allow easy, safe, and reliable changes to their resources.  This functionality can be used to introduce functionality such as suspending and enabling a Kubernetes cronjob, continue a BlueGreen deployment with Argo Rollouts, or scaling a deployment. 

#### UI Enhancements & Usability Enhancements

* New color palette intended to highlight unhealthily and out-of-sync resources more clearly.
* The health of more resources is displayed, so it easier to quickly zoom to unhealthy pods, replica-sets, etc.
* Resources that do not have health no longer appear to be healthy. 
* Support for configuring Git repo credentials at a domain/org level
* Support for configuring requested OIDC provider scopes and enforced RBAC scopes
* Support for configuring monitored resources whitelist in addition to excluded resources

## v0.12.0 (2019-03-23)

## Quick Start
### Non-HA:
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v0.12.0/manifests/install.yaml
```
### HA:
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v0.12.0/manifests/ha/install.yaml
```

## New Features

### Improved UI

Many improvements to the UI were made, including:

* Table view when viewing applications
* Filters on applications
* Table view when viewing application resources
* YAML editor in UI
* Switch to text-based diff instead of json diff
* Ability to edit application specs

### Custom Health Assessments (CRD Health)

Argo CD has long been able to perform health assessments on resources, however this could only
assess the health for a few native kubernetes types (deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets, etc...).
Now, Argo CD can be extended to gain understanding of any CRD health, in the form of Lua scripts.
For example, using this feature, Argo CD now understands the CertManager Certificate CRD and will
report a Degraded status when there are issues with the cert.

### Configuration Management Plugins

Argo CD introduces Config Management Plugins to support custom configuration management tools other
than the set that Argo CD provides out-of-the-box (Helm, Kustomize, Ksonnet, Jsonnet). Using config
management plugins, Argo CD can be configured to run specified commands to render manifests. This
makes it possible for Argo CD to support other config management tools (kubecfg, kapitan, shell
scripts, etc...).

### High Availability

Argo CD is now fully HA. A set HA of manifests are provided for users who wish to run Argo CD in
a highly available manner. NOTE: The HA installation will require at least three different nodes due
to pod anti-affinity roles in the specs.

### Improved Application Source

* Support for Kustomize 2
* YAML/JSON/Jsonnet Directories can now be recursed
* Support for Jsonnet external variables and top-level arguments

### Additional Prometheus Metrics

Argo CD provides the following additional prometheus metrics:
* Sync counter to track sync activity and results over time
* Application reconciliation (refresh) performance to track Argo CD performance and controller activity
* Argo CD API Server metrics for monitoring HTTP/gRPC requests

### Fuzzy Diff Logic

Argo CD can now be configured to ignore known differences for resource types by specifying a json
pointer to the field path to ignore. This helps prevent OutOfSync conditions when a user has no
control over the manifests. Ignored differences can be configured either at an application level, 
or a system level, based on a group/kind.

### Resource Exclusions

Argo CD can now be configured to completely ignore entire classes of resources group/kinds.
Excluding high-volume resources improves performance and memory usage, and reduces load and
bandwidth to the Kubernetes API server. It also allows users to fine-tune the permissions that
Argo CD needs to a cluster by preventing Argo CD from attempting to watch resources of that
group/kind.

### gRPC-Web Support

The argocd CLI can be now configured to communicate to the Argo CD API server using gRPC-Web
(HTTP1.1) using a new CLI flag `--grpc-web`. This resolves some compatibility issues users were
experiencing with ingresses and gRPC (HTTP2), and should enable argocd CLI to work with virtually
any load balancer, ingress controller, or API gateway.

### CLI features

Argo CD introduces some additional CLI commands:

* `argocd app edit APPNAME` - to edit an application spec using preferred EDITOR
* `argocd proj edit PROJNAME` - to edit an project spec using preferred EDITOR
* `argocd app patch APPNAME` - to patch an application spec
* `argocd app patch-resource APPNAME` - to patch a specific resource which is part of an application


## Breaking Changes

### Label selector changes, dex-server rename

The label selectors for deployments were been renamed to use kubernetes common labels
(`app.kuberentes.io/name=NAME` instead of `app=NAME`). Since K8s deployment label selectors are
immutable, during an upgrade from v0.11 to v0.12, the old deployments should be deleted using
`--cascade=false` which allows the new deployments to be created without introducing downtime.
Once the new deployments are ready, the older replicasets can be deleted. Use the following
instructions to upgrade from v0.11 to v0.12 without introducing downtime:

```
# delete the deployments with cascade=false. this orphan the replicasets, but leaves the pods running
kubectl delete deploy --cascade=false argocd-server argocd-repo-server argocd-application-controller

# apply the new manifests and wait for them to finish rolling out
kubectl apply <new install manifests>
kubectl rollout status deploy/argocd-application-controller
kubectl rollout status deploy/argocd-repo-server
kubectl rollout status deploy/argocd-application-controller

# delete old replicasets which are using the legacy label
kubectl delete rs -l app=argocd-server
kubectl delete rs -l app=argocd-repo-server
kubectl delete rs -l app=argocd-application-controller

# delete the legacy dex-server which was renamed
kubectl delete deploy dex-server
```

### Deprecation of spec.source.componentParameterOverrides

For declarative application specs, the `spec.source.componentParameterOverrides` field is now
deprecated in favor of application source specific config. They are replaced with new fields
specific to their respective config management. For example, a Helm application spec using the
legacy field:

```yaml
spec:
  source:
    componentParameterOverrides:
    - name: image.tag
      value: v1.2
```

should move to:

```yaml
spec:
  source:
    helm:
      parameters:
      - name: image.tag
        value: v1.2
```

Argo CD will automatically duplicate the legacy field values to the new locations (and vice versa)
as part of automatic migration. The legacy `spec.source.componentParameterOverrides` field will be
kept around for the v0.12 release (for migration purposes) and will be removed in the next Argo CD
release.

### Removal of spec.source.environment and spec.source.valuesFiles

The `spec.source.environment` and `spec.source.valuesFiles` fields, which were deprecated in v0.11,
are now completely removed from the Application spec.


### API/CLI compatibility

Due to API spec changes related to the deprecation of componentParameterOverrides, Argo CD v0.12
has a minimum client version of v0.12.0. Older CLI clients will be rejected.

kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v0.11.0/manifests/install.yaml
```

This is Argo CD's biggest release ever and introduces a completely redesigned controller architecture.

# New Features

## Performance & Scalability
The application controller has a completely redesigned architecture which improved performance and scalability during application reconciliation.

This was achieved by introducing an in-memory, live state cache of lightweight Kubernetes object metadata. During reconciliation, the controller no longer performs expensive, in-line queries of app related resources in K8s API server, instead relying on the metadata available in the live state cache. This dramatically improves performance and responsiveness, and is less burdensome to the K8s API server.

## Object relationship visualization for CRDs
With the new controller design, Argo CD is now able to understand ownership relationship between *all* Kubernetes objects, not just the built-in types. This enables Argo CD to visualize parent/child relationships between all kubernetes objects, including CRDs.

## Multi-namespaced applications
During sync, Argo CD will now honor any explicitly set namespace in a manifest. Manifests without a namespace will continue deploy to the "preferred" namespace, as specified in app's `spec.destination.namespace`. This enables support for a class of applications which install to multiple namespaces. For example, Argo CD can now install the [prometheus-operator](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator) helm chart, which deploys some resources into `kube-system`, and others into the `prometheus-operator` namespace.

## Large application support
Full resource objects are no longer stored in the Application CRD object status. Instead, only lightweight metadata is stored in the status, such as a resource's sync and health status. This change enabled Argo CD to support applications with a very large number of resources (e.g. istio), and reduces the bandwidth requirements when listing applications in the UI.

## Resource lifecycle hook improvements
Resource lifecycle hooks (e.g. PreSync, PostSync) are now visible/manageable from the UI. Additionally, bare Pods with a restart policy of Never can now be used as a resource hook, as an alternative to Jobs, Workflows.

## K8s recommended application labels
The tracking label for resources has been changed to use `app.kubernetes.io/instance`, as recommended in [Kubernetes recommended labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/), (changed from `applications.argoproj.io/app-name`). This will enable applications managed by Argo CD to interoperate with other tooling which are also converging on this labeling, such as the Kubernetes dashboard. Additionally, Argo CD no longer injects any tracking labels at the `spec.template.metadata` level.

## External OIDC provider support
Argo CD now supports auth delegation to an existing, external OIDC providers without the need for running Dex (e.g. Okta, OneLogin, Auth0, Microsoft, etc...)

The optional, [Dex IDP OIDC provider](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) is still bundled as part of the default installation, in order to provide a seamless out-of-box experience, enabling Argo CD to integrate with non-OIDC providers, and to benefit from Dex's full range of [connectors](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/tree/master/Documentation/connectors). 

## OIDC group bindings to Project Roles
OIDC group claims from an OAuth2 provider can now be bound to Argo CD project roles. Previously, group claims could only be managed in the centralized ConfigMap, `argocd-rbac-cm`. They can now be managed at a project level. This enables project admins to self service access to applications within a project.

## Declarative Argo CD configuration
Argo CD settings can be now be configured either declaratively, or imperatively. The `argocd-cm` ConfigMap now has a `repositories` field, which can reference credentials in a normal Kubernetes secret which you can create declaratively, outside of Argo CD. 

## Helm repository support
Helm repositories can be configured at the system level, enabling the deployment of helm charts which have a dependency to external helm repositories.

# Breaking changes:

* Argo CD's resource names were renamed for consistency. For example, the application-controller deployment was renamed to argocd-application-controller. When upgrading from v0.10 to v0.11, the older resources should be pruned to avoid inconsistent state and controller in-fighting. 
* As a consequence to moving to recommended kubernetes labels, when upgrading from v0.10 to v0.11, all applications will immediately be OutOfSync due to the change in tracking labels. This will correct itself with another sync of the application. However, since Pods will be recreated, please take this into consideration, especially if your applications are configured with auto-sync.
* There was significant reworking of the `app.status` fields to reduce the payload size, simplify the datastructure and remove fields which were no longer used by the controller. No breaking changes were made in `app.spec`.
* An older Argo CD CLI (v0.10 and below) will not be compatible with Argo CD v0.11. To keep CI pipelines in sync with the API server, it is recommended to have pipelines download the CLI directly from the API server https://${ARGOCD_SERVER}/download/argocd-linux-amd64 during the CI pipeline.

# Notes about upgrading from v0.7
* The RBAC model has been improved to support explicit denies. What this means is that any previous
RBAC policy rules, need to be rewritten to include one extra column with the effect:
`allow` or `deny`. For example, if a rule was written like this:
    ```
    p, my-org:my-team, applications, get, */*
    ```
    It should be rewritten to look like this:
    ```
    p, my-org:my-team, applications, get, */*, allow
    ```
